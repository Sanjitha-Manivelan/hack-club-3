I've created a website that discusses dog treats and how to use them, and I coded it in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I wanted to educate dog owners on how they can use dog treats to train their dogs and share more information on dog treats!

I made this project by following multiple tutorials and coded the rest with my own knowledge and eventhough there were lots of errors I am really happy with the final product!

I struggled with making the CSS of the website, the circular display of the images, and making the website usable on a phone and a computer.
